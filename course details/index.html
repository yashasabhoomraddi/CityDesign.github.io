    <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
    <p>As urbanization continues to surge, the demand for efficient and sustainable public transportation systems becomes increasingly critical. As cities expand, infrastructure often struggles to keep pace with the growing population, leading to traffic congestion, air pollution, and inefficient public transportation systems. These issues not only hinder economic growth but also reduce the quality of life for residents. Among these challenges, urban mobility remains a critical concern, as existing systems fail to cater to the increasing demands of daily commuters. This project focuses on designing a smart city with a special emphasis on innovative solutions for its subway systems and networks. </p>

    <p>Solving these urban challenges is essential to creating cities that are resilient and efficient. This project focuses on designing a smart city with advanced subway systems, using modern technologies to provide sustainable and effective transportation solutions. By reducing traffic congestion, cutting down carbon emissions, and improving access to public transport, the project aims to tackle the critical problems caused by urbanization. It seeks to promote sustainable urban growth while addressing key societal issues such as mobility and accessibility disparities.</p>

    <h2>3. Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>Implementation of an efficient Subway System: 
    Amongst the different modes of travel present today, railways and/or subway systems are one of the cheapest and most frequently chosen modes of transport by the public. Today in India, we face a myriad of problems in the railway system, such as overcrowding due to improper scheduling of trains and a lack of facilities offered to the public waiting to board. Efficient commute is the need of the hour, and that provided us with the impetus to work on resolving this issue.</p>

    <p>The domain of subway systems and networks involves the design, optimization, and management of rapid transit systems. It includes key aspects such as route planning, real-time monitoring, scheduling, passenger experience enhancement, etc.</p>
